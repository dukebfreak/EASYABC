/*
    Main file is responsible for executing the program. The file first asks the player how many boards he/she intends to
    play. This number is important because it lets the program know how many Lines of Text the program should read.One
    line of text represents one board that is needed to be solved. As long as there are more boards to be read, the 
    main method call the methods that are responsible for load the  36 X 36 game board, setting the 4X4 grid, solving 
    the 4X4 grid, and finally returning the letter that was filled in at the specified location written at the end of each 
    line in the text file. The main file should continually ouput the Letter at the specified location so long as there 
    are boards to be solved in teh following format:    "Character at specified location is: Letter". The main method does
    not take any paramters.
